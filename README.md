#Inrō#

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/randonia/ggj2015/screenshots/Screenshots/title_small.png)

You are a trio of fallen samurai. A master swordsman, an expert bowman, and a powerful mage. You have fulfilled your service to the Emperor and now must make your way to the afterlife, but first you must each collect your most prized possessions, kept in your inrō.

Navigate the spirit world fighting off whatever you must to achieve your goals. Then make your way back to the shrine for passage to eternal bliss.
